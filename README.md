This is our team 801 Horsepower's code for the 2026 season, FIRST Rebuilt. It is primarily maintained by Hudson Jimenez and Robert Ward, but it contains a large portion of code
copied from the previous season, the authors of which are listed in `pyproject.toml`.

This project is currently in development; there is little to no usable code at the moment.

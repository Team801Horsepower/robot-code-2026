# robot-code-2026
---
This is the robot code for Team 801 Horsepower's 2026 Season. It is currently a work in progress. The primary developer is Hudson Jimenez, although secondary contributors (whose code has been used from prior seasons) have been stated in the pyproject.toml file. Once the code nears release, a full download guide and more online docs will be published.
